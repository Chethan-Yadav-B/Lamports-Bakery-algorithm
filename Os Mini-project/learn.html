    <h1>Lamport's Bakery Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
      <dl>
      <dd>
        In Lamport's bakery algorithm, processes are treated as customers. In this, each
        process waiting to enter its critical section gets a token number, and the process with the
         lowest number enters the critical section. If two processes have the same token number,
         the process with a lower process ID enters its critical section.
      </dd>
    <dt>
      Algorithm :
    </dt>
    <dd>
      do{
          entering[i] :=  true; // show interest in critical section
         // get a token number
          number[i] := 1 + max(number[0],  number[1], ..., number[n - 1]);
          entering [i] :=  false;
          for ( j :=  0 ;  j {<} n; j++)
          {
       // busy wait until process Pj receives its token number
              while (entering [j])
              { ; } // do nothing
             while (number[j] !=  0 &&  (number[j], j) < (number[i], i)) // token comparison
               { ; } // do nothing
             }
              // critical section
               number[i] :=  0;  // Exit section
              // remainder section
          } while(1);
              Structure of process Pi for Lamport's bakery algorithm to critical section problem.  </dd>


    <dt>Explanation -</dt>
    <dt>
      This algorithm uses the following two Boolean variables.

      boolean entering[n];
      int number[n];
    </dt>
    <dd>
      ->All entering variables are initialized to false, and n integer variables numbers are all
      initialized to 0. The value of integer variables is used to form token numbers.

      ->When a process wishes to enter a critical section, it chooses a greater token number than
       any earlier number.

      ->Consider a process Pi wishes to enter a critical section, it sets

      entering[i] to true to make other processes aware that it is choosing a token number. It then
      chooses a token number greater than those held by other processes and writes its token number.
       Then it sets entering[i] to false after reading them. Then It enters a loop to evaluate the
       status of other processes. It waits until some other process Pj is choosing its token number.

      ->Pi then waits until all processes with smaller token numbers or the same token number but
      with higher priority are served fast.

      ->When the process has finished with its critical section execution, it resets its number
      variable to 0.

      ->The Bakery algorithm meets all the requirements of the critical section problem.

      Mutual Exclusion: we know that when no process is executing in its critical section, a process
       with the lowest number is allowed to enter its critical section. Suppose two processes have
       the same token number. In that case, the process with the lower process ID among these is
       selected as the process ID of each process is distinct, so at a particular time, there wil
       l be only one process executing in its critical section. Thus the requirement of mutual
       Exclusion is met.
      Progress: After selecting a token, a waiting process checks whether any other waiting process
       has higher priority to enter its critical section. If there is no such process, P will
       immediately enter its critical section. Thus meeting progress requirements.
      Bounded Waiting: As awaiting, the process will enter its critical section when no other process
      is in its critical section and
      If its token number is the smallest among other waiting processes.
      If token numbers are the same, it has the lowest process ID among other waiting processes.

    <dt>Advantages of Lamport's bakery algorithm</dt>
    <dd>
      ->Lamport's bakery algorithms are free from starvation.
      ->Lamport's Bakery algorithm follows a FIFO.
      ->Lamport's Bakery algorithm works with atomic registers.
      ->Lamport's Bakery algorithm is one of the simplest known solutions to the mutual exclusion
      problem for the general case of the N process.
      ->This algorithm ensures the efficient use of shared resources in a multithreaded environment.

    </dd>
    <dt>Disadvantages of Lamport's bakery algorithm</dt>
     <dd>
       -> Lamport's bakery algorithm is unreliable as a failure of any one of the processes will
       halt progress. It has a high message complexity of 3(N - 1) messages per entry/exit into the
       critical section.
